# Jonas_Jones Dashboard
This Dashboard connects the settings and configurations of most of the services of my ecosystem

## Accounts
It is possible for everyone to signup and get access to the settings, however most user scopes aren't available to the default user and need to be granted by an admin user.

## Settings and Configurations
The following are services that can be configured from the dashboard:
